### Snakes and Ladders
To demonstrate Swift by example, we implemented a very simple version of the [Snakes and Ladders game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders)

#### Game rules
- the board plane is 5x5 big
- the goal is to reach the field number 25
- each turn the player roles a dice and moves by that number (1 - 6) of squares
- more rules to come...

#### Stuff you need
It works only with a beta version of XCode (we used XCode 6b6) as the XCode 6 GM version doesn't support Swift for OSX.
